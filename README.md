# minetest-engine-luk3yx

This is a mostly unmaintained fork of an older up to dated version of Minetest
(0.4.17.1) to add features and bugfixes from 5.0.0 before 5.0.0 was officially
released and most servers were still on 0.4.17.1. Its pretty stable and know to work, 
but isnot official also is not bug free, does not recieve support and is only for 
modern OS's that cannot connect to older servers 0.4 versions.


description
---------------

This repository is only as historical reference. A minetest 0.4.18.3 version is  build 
from this sources, mostly most of the 5.0.0 improvements were added! any mod from 
the 5.X series will be compatible with this.

A [Minetest](https://github.com/minetest/minetest) fork with backported features
and bugfixes from 5.0.0. Most of them documented here: https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/6746/commits 
the sources were forked as new repo from https://github.com/luk3yx/minetest

In case you downloaded the source code:
---------------------------------------

If you downloaded this Minetest Engine source code in which this file is
contained, you probably want to download the Minetest game backported (check minenux project) 
or the original (https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/tree/stable-0.4) too.

In any case, is you use this sources must also use the backported one or the mientest minenux game for 0.4.

Paths
-----

Locations:

* `bin`   - Compiled binaries to execute program
* `share` - Distributed read-only data
* `user`  - User-created modifiable data

Where each location is on each platform:

* Windows:
    * bin   = `bin`
    * share = `.`
    * user  = `.`
* Linux:
    * `bin`   = `/usr/bin`
    * `share` = `/usr/share/minetest`
    * `user`  = `~/.minetest`
* macOS:
    * `bin`   = `Contents/MacOS`
    * `share` = `Contents/Resources`
    * `user`  = `Contents/User OR ~/Library/Application Support/minetest`

Worlds can be found as separate directory in: `user/worlds/`

Configuration file:
-------------------
- Default location:
    `/etc/minetest/minetest.conf`
- For `RUN_IN_PLACE` It is created by Minetest at first run:
    `user/minetest.conf`
- A specific file can be specified on the command line:
    `--config <path-to-file>`
- A run-in-place build will look for the configuration file in
    `bin/../minetest.conf` and also `bin/../../minetest.conf`

Command-line options:
---------------------
- Use `--help`

Compiling
---------

This compilation requires GIT.

#### Dependencies

#### Download

Download source (this is the URL to the latest of source repository, which might not work at all times) using Git:

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/luk3yx/minetest.git
    cd minetest

Download minetest_game (otherwise only the "Minimal development test" game is available) using Git:

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/luk3yx/minetest_game.git games/minetest_game

Download source, without using Git:

    wget https://github.com/luk3yx/minetest/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar xf master.tar.gz
    cd minetest-master

Download minetest_game, without using Git:

    cd games/
    wget https://github.com/luk3yx/minetest_game/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar xf master.tar.gz
    mv minetest_game-master minetest_game
    cd ..

#### Build

Build a version that runs directly from the source directory:

    cmake . -DRUN_IN_PLACE=TRUE
    make -j <number of processors>

Run it:

    ./bin/minetest

- Use `cmake . -LH` to see all CMake options and their current state
- If you want to install it system-wide (or are making a distribution package),
  you will want to use `-DRUN_IN_PLACE=FALSE`
- You can build a bare server by specifying `-DBUILD_SERVER=TRUE`
- You can disable the client build by specifying `-DBUILD_CLIENT=FALSE`
- You can select between Release and Debug build by `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug or Release>`
  - Debug build is slower, but gives much more useful output in a debugger
- If you build a bare server, you don't need to have Irrlicht installed.
  - In that case use `-DIRRLICHT_SOURCE_DIR=/the/irrlicht/source`

Docker ("stock" Minetest)
------
Minetest provides Minetest server docker images using the Gitlab mirror registry.

Images are built on each commit and available using the following tag scheme:

* `registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:latest` (latest build)
* `registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:<branch/tag>` (current branch or current tag)
* `registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:<commit-id>` (current commit id)

If you want to test it on a docker server, you can easily run:

	sudo docker run registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:<docker tag>

If you want to use it in a production environment you should use volumes bound to the docker host
to persist data and modify the configuration:

	sudo docker create -v /home/minetest/data/:/var/lib/minetest/ -v /home/minetest/conf/:/etc/minetest/ registry.gitlab.com/minetest/minetest/server:master

Data will be written to `/home/minetest/data` on the host, and configuration will be read from `/home/minetest/conf/minetest.conf`.

Note: If you don't understand the previous commands, please read the official Docker documentation before use.

You can also host your minetest server inside a Kubernetes cluster. See our example implementation in `misc/kubernetes.yml`.
